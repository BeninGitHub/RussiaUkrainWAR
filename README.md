### Motivation
Online social networks such as Twitter play an important role in how people stay informed and exchange reactions. In particular, online social networks during crisis events embody a key opportunity for studying the portability of computational models for various tasks (e.g., information extraction, complex event understanding, misinformation detection, etc.), due to differences in domain, entities, and event types. Wepresent the **Russia-Ukraine Crisis dataset**, with over 500K public user posts and comments in our first release.

### Dataset Details
We initiated our data collection process when the crisis escalated with Russia's special military operation on April first till April 10th, that because we were trying to bring a specific data regarding what happened in Kyiev, the capital city of Ukrain. in that time Russia almost took over the capital of Ukraine and we could have seen that the comments all over the internet changing from side to side. The following information are included in the *Russia-Ukraine Crisis* dataset:
|      |  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| user information     | username, location, following, followers    |
| post content  | the main text      |
| post comments | information similar to the previous three rows, for all comments underneath a user post      |


### Use Cases
There are many interesting task settings that can be experimented with, using our Russo-Ukranian Crises Twitter dataset. These include event clustering, false rumor detection, protability of news analytic methodologies across Twitter.

### Related Work
A team at Git has released a [Russo-Ukranian Crises Twitter dataset](https://github.com/ehsanulhaq1/russo_ukraine_dataset). It is generally interesting to uncover patterns universal across platforms, regulated by a separate set of rules and participated by a separate set of users with different user behavior. Note that Twitter data (multilingual) involves English as the primary language.
